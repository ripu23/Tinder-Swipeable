# Tinder-Swipeable
This application is again a part of a tutorial series. This application is a working prototype of a tinder model. The screen has swipeable cards, which I have built using [React-native elements](https://react-native-elements.github.io/react-native-elements/docs/overview.html). 

## Technolgies
`React-native`
